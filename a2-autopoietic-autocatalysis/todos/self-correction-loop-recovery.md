# Self-Correction Loop Recovery TODO

Created: 2026-05-10

## Current status

Working:

- Prior lineage is wired into retry attempts.
- `a2ctl run --apply` reconciles post-apply verification truth into lineage.
- Prior motifs render external verification failures, stdout-first details, and `failure_focus`.
- WorktreeCatalyst prompt states prior `external_verification` failures are authoritative.
- Self-correction JSONL records touched files and diff line counts.

Not working:

- `compound-hidden` still does not self-correct.
- Minimax and Kimi attempts repeatedly touch only `a2_core/src/lib.rs`.
- The hidden `a2ctl` scan-marker regression remains unfixed across retry attempts.

## Recovery sequence

Implement these in order; each one should be committed atomically and verified before the next:

1. `todos/structured-external-verification.md`
2. `todos/retry-task-contract-from-verification.md`
3. `todos/verifier-derived-relevant-files.md`
4. `todos/anti-repeat-retry-strategy.md`
5. `todos/worktree-task-verifier.md`

## Benchmark gate

After each structural change, run at least one `compound-hidden` N=3 smoke with an available non-Claude provider:

```bash
bench/self_correction.py --fixture compound-hidden \
  --provider opencode/minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.7 \
  --attempts 3 \
  --results /tmp/a2-compound-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).jsonl
```

Then score:

```bash
bench/self_correction_score.py /tmp/a2-compound-*.jsonl
```

Do not claim broad success from a single run; use these runs as development feedback only. Report exact facts: attempts, prior lineage presence, touched files, and resolved/self-corrected counts.
